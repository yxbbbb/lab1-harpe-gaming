                <h1>Decide the Fate of the World</h1>
                <p><strong>Alliance</strong> challenges you and your opponents to decide 
                the outcome. As one of the world powers 
                battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
                military drive; but you can't do it alone. 
                You have to form alliances and then betray your 
                allies before they betray you!</p>
                <p>Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
                of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
                raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion 
                with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, 
                move into enemy territory with your forces and win 
                the conflict.</p>
                <p>The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. 
                Buy armaments and develop secret weapons from your country's economic funds and 
                natural reserves, but be sure to save 
                something for the future.</p>

                        <dd><p>Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is 
                        just about perfect and each player must 
                        carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the 
                        strategic possibilities are nearly endless, 
                        the game is simple to learn. The replay value is 
                        high and gets even better when you replace 
                        some of the cards with new cards available in the 
                        expansion packs.</p></dd>
                        <dd><p>We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
                        In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
                        reading and rereading the rule book than actually 
                        playing the game. If you want to read a 
                        book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.</p></dd>

                        <dd><p>Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the 
                        game play to be robust and engaging. The 
                        rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with 
                        experience in this class of board games, there 
                        is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We 
                        think the battle simulation cards are some of 
                        the best we have encountered.</p></dd>

                        <dd><p>Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to 
                        war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new 
                        ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the 
                        investment options give the game a "real world" feel.</p></dd>
